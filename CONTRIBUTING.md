# Contribution guide
There are several ways a user can contribute to this project: presenting bugs or security issues, and by solving any already posted issue by contributing code.

When mentioning <Subproject>, one of the next options should appear:

* Presentation: when refering to changes in Readme, Changelog or contribution guides
* Posixutils: when changes apply to any tool inside the `posix/` folder or manual pages of the utilities.

## Presenting bugs or security issues
As our team can't test all the corner cases for all the utilities, it is important that users that find bugs or security issues post them to us so we can fix them. That can be done with _Github's_ issue system. There, you can post any issue following the next format:

**Title**: <Subproject>: summary of the issue
  
**Body**: A more detailed explanation about the issue. If the issue is a bug, a guide on how to reproduce it would be very useful.

Issues can also be used to propose changes or discuse new features. In that case, the issue format should be the next:

**Title**: Proposal: summary of the proposal
  
**Body**: A more detailed explanation about the proposal and some useful cases where it would be nice to have.

## Contributing code
Code contributions are very helpful aswell as there is no full time developer working on the project. Code contributions are done with _Github's_ pull request system. The pull request should follow the next format:

**Title**: < Subproject >: summary of the changes or fixed issue
  
**Body**: A more detailed explanation about the changes and why they where necessary (if necessary, mention the issue that is fixed).
