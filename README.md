# Command line utils
Lightweight command line utilities for the GalardOS operating system. The goal with these utilities is to provide the typical programs that you could expect on a POSIX OS.

The aim is to use [busybox](busybox.net) tests to verify spec compliant behaviour and custom tests for own built utilities.

## Status
This project is currently under heavy development and should not be used in production.
